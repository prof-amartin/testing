<h1 style="color:red">American Society for Velociraptor Attack Prevention</h1><!--this is an example of an inline css style-->
    <p>Velociraptor attack is the 3rd leading cause of death for men age 27-29. 
However, everyone must think about the implications of velociraptors: 
young and old, men, women and transgendered persons.
    </p>
    <p>The American Society for Velociraptor Attack Prevention is a bi-partisan 
group of professionals, dedicated to the diffusion of knowledge concerning 
velociraptor attack prevention.
    </p>
<h2>Know the Enemy</h2>
    <p>The velociraptor is a bipedal carnivore with a long, stiffened tail and 
can be distinguished from other dromaeosaurids by its long and low skull, 
with an upturned snout. It has a relatively large, sickle-shaped claw, 
typical of dromaeosaurid and troodontid dinosaurs. This enlarged claw, up 
to 67 millimeters (2.6 in) long around its outer edge, is a predatory 
device, used to tear into the prey, delivering a fatal blow.
    </p>
    <p>Velociraptors are commonly found on tropical islands, converted to 
millionaire amusement parks, but are commonly being sighted in the Pacific 
Northwest.
    </p>
<h3>Essential facts you should know about velociraptors:</h3>
<ul>    
    <li>Velociraptors hunt in packs, and are known to form an equilateral triangle 
    around its prey.
    </li>
    <li>Velociraptors can accelerate 4 m/s2, with a top speed of 25 m/s on open 
    terrain, 10 m/s while wounded, and 10 m/s in indoor laboratories.
    </li>
    <li>Velociraptors can open doors, but are slowed by them. They can open an 
    initial door in approximately 5 minutes, and will take half that time for 
    each subsequent door.
    </li>
    <li>Velociraptors do not know fear.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>New Home Buyer Tips</h4>
    <p>When buying a new home, there are a few things to look out for when 
    assessing potential velociraptor attacks:
    </p>
<ol>
    <li>Check all doors and windows. Doors should be made of solid oak or steel. 
    Windows should have steel bars with spacing smaller than the average 
    raptor.
    </li>
    <li>
    Make sure all entryways have adequate deadbolts. Quality deadbolts may be 
    purchased at your local Home Depot.
    </li>
    <li>Always keep a loaded big-game rifle under your bed, and tire irons near 
    every door. Remember, you should never be farther than 20 feet away from a 
    tire iron.
    </li>
